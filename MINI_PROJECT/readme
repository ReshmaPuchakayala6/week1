Securing Healthcare with Deep Learning: A CNN-Based Model for medical IoT Threat Detection
Welcome to the repository accompanying our paper, "Securing Healthcare with Deep Learning: A CNN-Based Model for medical IoT Threat Detection" This work was presented at the 2024 19th Iranian Conference on Intelligent Systems (ICIS) held from October 23-24, 2024 (IEEE indexed Conference), at Sirjan University of Technology in Sirjan, Kerman, Iran.

Achievements and Contributions
The proposed model achieved a perfect accuracy of 0.99 across binary, categorical, and multiclass classification tasks, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods.

Code Developer
Alireza Mohammadi (Department of Computer Engineering, Islamic Azad University - Kermanshah Branch, Kermanshah, Iran)

Project Overview
This repository includes the code and setup instructions for implementing our proposed CNN-based intrusion detection model for IoMT systems. The model performs multi-class classification on network traffic to distinguish between 19 attack types and benign traffic, based on the CICIoMT2024 dataset.

Model Performance Metrics
Model Classification Task	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score
Proposed Model (19 Class)	0.99	0.98	0.99	0.98
Proposed Model (2 Class)	0.99	0.99	0.99	0.99
Proposed Model (6 Class)	0.99	0.99	0.99	0.99

fcn8_page-0001 (1) Architecture of the CNN model for IoMT attack classification

Getting Started
1. Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
Required Libraries: Install dependencies by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Data Preparation
Dataset:
Download the "CIC IoMT dataset 2024" dataset in CSV format from here(details in README_DATA.md). After downloading, extract and place the CSV files in the appropriate directories (data/train/ and data/test/).

3. Training and Evaluation
Navigate to the src directory:

cd src
To run the model, execute main.py and specify the classification configuration:

python main.py --class_config <num_classes>
Replace <num_classes> with:

2 for binary classification,
6 for categorical,
19 for multiclass.
